1. Below we append a question mark to create an optional param.
```ts
const family = (mom: string, dad: string, daughter?: string) => {
    console.log(`the mother ${mom}, the father ${dad}, the daughter ${daughter}`);
};


console.log(family('michele', 'milton'));
```

2. To create a default param so undefined is not delivered to the user, we can decalre a default value in the params
```ts
const family = (mom: string, dad: string, daughter="daughter") => {
    console.log(`the mother ${mom}, the father ${dad}, the daughter ${daughter}`);
};


console.log(family('michele', 'milton'));
```
